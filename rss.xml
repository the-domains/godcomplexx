            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five Four + Marvel Collection</h1><p>Some comic book apparel can end up juvenile, but the new Five Four collaboration with Marvel is anything but. In celebration of the impending release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Five Four subscription menswear service finds subtlety in the generally loud graphic medium by using Marvel's famous roster of superheroes to inspire its April capsule.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c00f82bc7a96b03780b683692320bb03f3b031f2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book's Brand New Update</h1><p>There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
